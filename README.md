## chat app in C  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
for now it doesn't support many client's due to usage of 2 different queues (one for client and one for one client - hardcoded)
usage of only one queue can be hard due to need of differentiation between messages for different users (user cannot listen to messages for different one)

### instruction of usage (just compile it xd)

### description of used structures

### description of way server communicates with users
